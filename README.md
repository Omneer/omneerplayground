## Introduction

Our solution comprises three main components:

1. Early Detection Model: AI-driven models for early detection of brain tumors using accessible biomarker data.
2. Personalized Treatment Plans: Personalized treatment plans generated by integrating patient data, genomics, and AI predictions.
3. Patient Monitoring and Treatment Adjustment: Advanced AI algorithms for monitoring patient progress and adjusting treatment plans as needed.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Flask

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```python
git clone https://github.com/yourcompany/brain-tumor-management.git
cd brain-tumor-management
```

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:
```python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the required projects
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Early Detection Model

1. Train the early detection model:
```python
python train_early_detection.py
```

2. Use the early detection model to predict the presence of brain tumors:
```python
python predict_early_detection.py --input data/sample_input.csv --output results/predictions.csv
```


### Personalized Treatment Plans

1. Train the personalized treatment model:

```python
python train_personalized_treatment.py
```

2. Generate personalized treatment plans:
```python
python predict_personalized_treatment.py --input data/sample_input.csv --output results/treatment_plans.csv
```

### Patient Monitoring and Treatment Adjustment

1. Train the patient monitoring model:
```python
python train_patient_monitoring.py
```

2. Monitor patient progress and adjust treatment plans:
```python
python predict_patient_monitoring.py --input data/sample_input.csv --output results/monitoring_results.csv
```
